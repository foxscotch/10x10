Definitions:

Grid = the 10x10 game board that the game is played on
Piece = the shaped collections of blocks placed on the grid
Block = the individual squares that make up pieces


Rules:

You are given three random pieces to choose from to place on the grid. When all three are used, three more random pieces are given, and so on.
When a full row or column on the grid is filled with blocks, that row or column is cleared.
Scoring:
    Piece placed: 1 point per block
    Rows/columns cleared: 5 * cleared * (cleared + 1)


Classic 1010 pieces and their names and weights per rotation:

x          one, 2

x x        two, 3 (*2 rotations)

x x x      thr, 3 (*2 rotations)

x x x x    fou, 2 (*2 rotations)

x x x x x  fiv, 2 (*2 rotations)

I got the score function and weight information came from this page:

Sizes:

Full blocks:
    64px square
    4px between blocks
    The entire 10x10 grid is therefore 674x674px
Selection area blocks:
    40px square
    2px between blocks (does not necessarily need to be exact? proportions will be more important)
Grabbed blocks:
    58px square
    10px between blocks (more important is that their centers are as far apart from each other as full block centers)


Desired non-classic features (to come after classic gameplay is implemented):

Custom blocks and their weights and colors
Custom grid sizes
Custom color themes
Sandbox mode (all blocks are available and can be placed at any time)
Arcade mode
    Larger default grid? 15x15 maybe?
    Lives? Maybe when no blocks can be placed, some blocks on the grid are deleted and a set of pieces with at least one
      guaranteed-placeable piece is given, along with the removal of a life.
    Power-ups? Earning power-ups could function like earning stars from the real game.
        Clear - clears one block
        RowClear - clears one row
        ColumnClear - clears one column
        Could use some more interesting options.
