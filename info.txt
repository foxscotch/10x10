Definitions:

Grid = the 10x10 game board that the game is played on
Piece = the shaped collections of blocks placed on the grid
Block = the individual squares that make up pieces


Rules:

You are given three random pieces to choose from to place on the grid. When all three are used, three more random pieces are given, and so on.
When a full row or column on the grid is filled with blocks, that row or column is cleared.
Scoring:
    Piece placed: 1 point per block
    Rows/columns cleared: 5 * cleared * (cleared + 1)
