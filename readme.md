# 10x10

This is a game based on the rad [1010! by Gram Games][1010]. The title is
probably not permanent, but we'll see how it goes.

It is dependent on LÃ–VE 11.1, and some external libraries, which are located in
the ext/ directory with their licenses. If they don't have version numbers, I'll
just specify the date that I downloaded the code.

 - [hump][hump] (0.4-2)
 - [knife][knife] (pulled on July 17, 2018)

 Hump and Knife generally provide similar facilities, so in any instances where
 they share a feature, I tend to choose Hump's implementation.
